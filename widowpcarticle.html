         <h1 class="article"> Mouse and keyboard players are destroying controller users in Overwatch on console </h1>
		 <h2 class="brief">Jeff Kaplan says Blizzard "objects to the use of mouse and keyboard on console."</h2>

		The conventional wisdom is that a mouse and keyboard setup is better for playing shooters than a controller, because mice are inherently faster and more precise aiming devices. That's why, generally speaking, PC and console players are kept separate from one another (and also why Microsoft's recent decision to let Gears 4 PC and console players commingle was noteworthy). But what happens when console players use mouse/keyboard setups in action against other consolers? 
		</p>
		<p class="article">
	The question was asked last week on the Overwatch forums, when a poster claimed that "the majority of high level players are using mouse and keyboard on console." The person said they believe it's unfair to other players, but wanted to know what Blizzard's official stance on the matter is—and, if it's considered cheating, "what is being done to protect console players using a controller." 
        </p>    
		<p class="article">
		"The Overwatch team objects to the use of mouse and keyboard on console. We have contacted both first-party console manufacturers and expressed our concern about the use of mouse and keyboard and input conversion devices," game director Jeff Kaplan replied bluntly. "We have lobbied and will continue to lobby for first-party console manufacturers to either disallow mouse and keyboard and input conversion devices, OR openly and easily support mouse and keyboard for ALL players." 
		</p>
		<p class="article">
		That last bit refers to the fact that you can't just plug a mouse and keyboard into your console of choice and have at it: Some games support them, but others don't. To get around that limitation, you have to use an input conversion device like the XIM4, which lists for $150 on Amazon—and that's without the mouse and keyboard. In other words, people are paying (quite a lot) for a significant in-game advantage.
