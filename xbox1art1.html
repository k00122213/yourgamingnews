		Developer 343 Industries this week pushed out new patches for first-person shooter Halo 5: Guardians and the RTS Halo Wars 2, introducing new features and tweaking balance, among other things.

		The Halo 5 update includes fixes, tweaks, and improvements to many aspects of the game, though the focus is on the map- and mode-making Forge tools for Xbox One and PC.
</p>
	
		<p class="article">
		Specifically, the rendering performance for some Forge objects has been "greatly improved" and should no longer have as many frame rate issues. The update also fixes a problem where some user-made maps were corrupted or impossible to load. A new feature comes to Forge with this update in the form of "score to win" now being available as a value source.
</p>    
		<p class="article">
		Additionally, this Halo 5 update includes the previously announced motion sensor/radar changes that are being evaluated in the special "Proving Grounds" playlist. You can learn more about what's changing here--these changes could be rolled into future Halo games including Halo 6.
</p>
		
		<p class="article">
		Switching to Halo Wars 2, that game's patch is out now on Xbox One and should arrive later this week on PC. The 9.9 GB update fixes a number of bugs, including one where units became unresponsive in the Blitz mode. It also clears out a problem where some units could get stuck in bases. Additionally, this patch sets the default difficulty for AI to "normal" from "easy," (you can change this) and lays the groundwork for ranked multiplayer, which is still not available.
</p>
		<p class="article">
		43 added that it is aware of a number of other Halo Wars 2 issues, including instances when the game freezes or drops frame rate significantly, but that problem and others will be fixed in future patches.
