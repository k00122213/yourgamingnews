		This weekend, it's time to climb that wall, to inevitably fall from that wall, and then to climb up that wall all over again. It's also time to test your brain, to explore a forgotten city, and to see what those weird terminals are all about. Enjoy!

		<h3>Fragments of Euclid by Antoine Zanuttini  </h3>

		 </div>
		<p class="article">
	Sometimes, when I write about a small, really a sketch of a game, I'll note that I hope the developer returns to flesh out the idea sometime in the future. Most of the time, as far as I know, that doesn't happen, but I'm delighted to say that Non Euclidean Room creator Antoine Zanuttini has returned to the concept of his spatially tricksy (but sadly pretty easy) first-person puzzler.
    </p>    
		<p class="article">
		The result is Fragments of Euclid: a bigger, far more involved puzzle game that turns the world on its head, before turning that world on its side, and then asking you to solve puzzles while trying to remember which way up is across several different rooms. It's bloody smart and bloody difficult, is what I'm saying, so if you like your puzzlers to actually, y'know, puzzle you, you're going to find your brain is being seriously tested here.

		<h3>Climb Fall Repeat by Drew Fletcher</h3>
		<div class="articlepic">

		 </div>
		<p class="article">
		Oddly, I'm reminded most here of the climbing bits of 1960s Batman series, because as enjoyable as I find the endless clambering of Climb Fall Repeat, it kinda looks like you're crawling all over the ground instead. Regardless, this scrolling arcade-style game—where you have to ascend a treacherous mountain while dodging piles and piles of falling boulders—is pretty fun, not to mention pretty, well, pretty, on account of those lovely low-poly environments.
